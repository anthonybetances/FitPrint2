## FitPrint

This app is a work in progress.  So far, users are allowed to register, and add their current and goal weights.  The app recommends daily calorie and macronutrient goals based on these variables, and they can be updated as the user updates their weight.  The user can also delete their profile.  The next step will be giving functionality to the meal inputs and submission buttons, so that users are able to add foods (and their respective caloric and macro info) to each meal, see them in a list which totlas these values for each meal and for the entire day, and delete items from their meal plan as needed.

## Background
This year, I’ve been using the myfitnesspal app to track my calories and macros in an effort to lose weight and maintain my fitness, and it worked.  My biggest gripe with the app is that it’s entirely on you to create your meals from the different foods.  The app has a section where it posts Huffington Post-like articles suggesting recipes and things to try, but it doesn’t make suggestions based on your likes/dislikes, and there’s no way to select a pre-made recipe and easily add it as a meal or to a meal unless you've already done the work to set it up yourself.  This project is the beginning of what will become a full-stack tracker with a recipe bank that suggests recipes according to the macros and calories that you still have left in the day, and allows you to add them to your meal plan, store for later, and use again.
